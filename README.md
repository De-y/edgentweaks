# Making edgenuity bearable, one feature at a time.

Edgentweaks enhances your edgenuity experience by adding multiple features into edgenuity to make edgenuity a little more bearable. 

# The story
Edgentweaks was priginally made by a group of developers & then maintained by Gradyn in 2017 after it was abandoned on r/edgenuity, then they got a cease & desist from Edgenuity, so they stopped maintaining it. Then @SubatomicMC became the next maintainer of the project, but they too got a cease and desist from edgenuity, so they stopped maintaining it aswell, leaving the project abandoned until now. This project is currently being maintained by de-y, and will continue being maintained till the end of the 2022-2023 school year.
